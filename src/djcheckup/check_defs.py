    name="Is your Django admin site exposed at the default URL?",

    success=False,
    severity=SeverityWeight.HIGH,
    success_message="""
Your Django admin site is not exposed at the default URL. This reduces the risk of automated attacks.
""",
    failure_message="""
Your Django admin site is accessible at the default URL (`/admin`).

Best practice is to restrict admin access to trusted IPs, use strong authentication, and change the admin URL to a
non-default, unguessable value. Never expose the admin over HTTP; always use HTTPS.

    success=True,
    severity=SeverityWeight.LOW,
    success_message="CSRF cookie detected. Your site is protected against cross-site request forgery attacks.",
    failure_message="""
No CSRF cookie was found. This is expected if your site does not render any forms that require CSRF protection on this
page. If you have forms that perform POST, PUT, or DELETE requests, ensure Django's CSRF middleware is enabled and not
bypassed.

    success=False,
    severity=SeverityWeight.MEDIUM,
    success_message="Your CSRF cookie is marked as HttpOnly, which helps prevent some XSS attacks.",
    failure_message="""
Your CSRF cookie is not marked as HttpOnly. While Django does not set this by default
(to allow JavaScript access for some use cases), setting HttpOnly can help mitigate certain XSS risks.
Consider your application's needs before enabling this.

Your CSRF cookie is not marked as Secure. This means it could be sent over unencrypted HTTP,
exposing it to interception. Set `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in your Django settings.

    success_message="Your site correctly returns a 404 error for non-existent pages.",
    failure_message="""
Your site does not return a 404 error for non-existent pages. This may indicate a misconfiguration or a custom error
handler that does not set the correct status code.

production. Set `DEBUG = False` in your settings.

Your site does not send the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header. This means browsers may allow users to visit your
site over HTTP, exposing them to downgrade attacks.

relies on sessions for authentication or user data, ensure Django's session middleware is enabled and configured
correctly.
